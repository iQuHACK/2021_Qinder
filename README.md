# Welcome to Qinder!
Our team has harnessed the power of quantum annealing to create a dating platform that matches you with your entangled pair as quickly as light travels.

We created an optimal stable marriage algorithm with DWave that accepts sets of individuals and their respective compatibilities with each other, and outputs the best dating pairs.

We've noticed that popular survey-based dating platforms, such as Datamatch and Aphrodite, take eons to generate matches, and wished to hasten the search for a significant other. 

Run 'python main.py' to start up our sleek web-app, and get you and your friends matched together.

Our next step is to allow free usage of Qinder by MIT-based dating services. We expect for talented MIT students to fall in love with the software, and a fraction to later work full-time at dating platform companies, such as Tinder and Bumble. We will encourage them to rave about Qinder, spurring desire for our software for popular dating services. Qinder will then be sold to large dating platforms to help increase the love in the world.
